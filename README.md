# First_repository

**Welcome!**

This is my first repository! I made it during the first part of the course of Digital Literary Studies, held by the brilliant Professor Emmanuela Carb√©, at the Ca' Foscari University in Venice. The objective of this first repository is to get familiar with the platform GitHub, but also to understand some fundamental tools of the Digital Literary Studies field.

In this repository, you'll find three different works and the tools used in order to make them. 
* **"Exercise_1.md"**: Project Gutenberg, Dillinger, first approach to Markdown
* **"Exercise_2.md"**: Internet Archives, OCR softwares (I choose Google Documents)
* **"Busdon_readings**: software for making tables (I choose Google Excel), CSV format
