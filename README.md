# First_repository

**Welcome!**

This is my first repository! I made it during the first part of the course of Digital Literary Studies, held by the brilliant Professor Emmanuela Carbé, at the Ca' Foscari University in Venice. The objective of this first repository is to get familiar with the platform GitHub, but also to understand some fundamental tools of the Digital Literary Studies field.

In this repository, you'll find three different works and a brief description of the tools used in order to make them:

* **"Exercise_1.md"**: Project Gutenberg, Dillinger, first approach to Markdown
* **"Exercise_2.md"**: Internet Archives, OCR softwares (I choose Google Documents)
* **"Busdon_readings**: software for making tables (I choose Google Excel), CSV format

For now, I put them in to the main brench of the repository, just because I was focused on gaining confidence in the use of the GitHub platform. I learnt from scratch how to use some softwares I didn't know about, but I also discovered new features of the tools I already knew about.

*Let's check them one by one!*

## Exercise_1.md

For this first exercise, I needed to find a novel which was copyright free. That's why I ventured in the [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)'s archive, a website full of novels and other books avaiable on the Public Domain. Here I found a Robert Louis Stevenson's novel, [*"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr.Hyde"*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/43/43-h/43-h.htm). 

I downloaded the novel in the HTML language, and uploaded a copy of its first chapter (*"Story of the door"*) on an online editor, Dillinger.io. Here I could see both the Markdown language and the preview of the text that will be visible to the user.

Then I decided to make some edits to the original text: I choose to highlight with **blod text** the name of **Mr. Utterson** the lawyer, while for recognising his friend I used both **bold** and *italics*, obtaining this result: ***Mr. Richard Enfield***.

I also added some hypertextual links. In particular, I wanted to link the places mentioned in the first chapter of the novel to their respective Wikipedia's webpage.

After this, I uploaded a copy of my Dillinger.io work on a .md file here on GitHub. In this way, i could make some additional updates, like the addiction of an image in .svg format.
