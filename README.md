# First_repository

**Welcome!**

This is my first repository! 

I made it during the first part of the course of **Digital Literary Studies**, held by the brilliant Professor Emmanuela Carbé, at the Ca' Foscari University in Venice. The objective of this first repository is to get familiar with the platform GitHub, but also to understand some fundamental tools of the Digital Literary Studies field.

In this repository, you'll find three different works and a brief description of the tools used in order to make them:

* **"Exercise_1.md"**: Project Gutenberg, Dillinger, first approach to Markdown
* **"Exercise_2.md"**: Internet Archives, OCR softwares (I choose Google Documents)
* **"Busdon_readings-Foglio1.csv**: software for making tables (I choose Google Excel), CSV format

For now, I put them in to the main brench of the repository, just because I was focused on gaining confidence in the use of the GitHub platform. I learnt from scratch how to use some softwares I didn't know about, but I also discovered new features of the tools I already knew about.

*Let's check them one by one!*

## Exercise_1.md

For this first exercise, I needed to find a novel which was copyright free. That's why I ventured in the [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)'s archive, a website full of novels and other books avaiable on the Public Domain. Here I found a Robert Louis Stevenson's novel, [*"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr.Hyde"*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/43/43-h/43-h.htm). 

I downloaded it in the HTML language, and uploaded a copy of its first chapter (*"Story of the door"*) on an online editor, Dillinger.io. Here I could see both the Markdown language and the preview of the text that will be visible to the user.

Then I decided to make some edits to the original text: I choose to highlight with **blod text** the name of **Mr. Utterson** the lawyer, while for recognising his friend I used both **bold** and *italics*, obtaining this result: ***Mr. Richard Enfield***.

I also added some hypertextual links. In particular, I wanted to link the places mentioned in the first chapter of the novel to their respective Wikipedia's webpage.

After this, I uploaded a copy of my Dillinger.io work on a .md file here on GitHub. In this way, i could make some additional updates, like the addiction of an image of the drawing of a [lawyer](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Advokat%2C_Engelsk_advokatdr%C3%A4kt%2C_Nordisk_familjebok.svg) in .svg format, taken from Wikimedia Commons.

## Exercise_2.md

For the creation of this file, I started exploring the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)'s website. It's an initiative similiar to the aforementioned Project Gutenberg, but my aim this time was to find either a digitized printed novel or a manuscript. After a while, I decided to stick with the works of Robert Louis Stevenson, and picked the novel [The Black Arrow](https://archive.org/details/blackarrowstev00stev/page/n3/mode/2up?ref=ol). The first edition was of 1888, but the one I found on Interent Archive is a later edition of 1926 (R. L. Stevenson, *"The Black Arrow"*, 1926, Boston, Allyn and Bacon).

This time, I needed to work with an OCR tool. I used Google Documents as an Octical Character Recognition tool: when inserting an image in, for example, a .png format (as I did), the software automatically recognises any word present in the image and traslates it in a format readable by the computer. Of course, it's not a smooth process: especially when working with old manuscripts, several edits are required in order to obtain a clean, machine-readable text.

I created a different file for every screenshot taken of the novel's first chapter (*"BOOK 1: THE TWO LADS; CHAPTER 1: AT THE SIGN OF THE SUN IN KETTLEY"*), cleared the formatting and then edited the text. Then I put the different files togheter in a single Google Document and went once again on Dillinger.io.

This time, I put in **bold** text the name of the knight **Sir Daniel Brackley**, while on both **bold** and *italics* the name of ***Condall***, a man brought upon Sir Daniel for treason. The other names present in the chapter, like *Jhon*, *Joanna* and *Sir Oliver*, were all highlighted with *italics*.

Then, after bringing the work here on GitHub as a .md file once again, I edited it some more, adding the links to the [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) Wikipedia page, and to the [Kettleburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettleburgh) one, which is one of the possible cities from which Stevenson may have taken inspiration from for the city of Kettley, where the story takes place.

## Busdon_readings-Foglio1.csv

In the last exercise of this repository, I worked on the creation of a table, in which I put some of my favorite readings. This time I used Google Sheets, another tool of Google Workspace, in order to create a small dataset. 

I put in the dataset ten novels (column **Item_number**), inserting their original title (**Original_Title**), name and surname of the author (**Author_Name**,**Author_Surname**), publishing year of the first edition (**First_edition**), language of the first edition (**Fe_Language**), publishing house or publisher (**Fe_Publishing_House**). Then, in the same row, I inserted the metadeta of every edition read by me: publishing year (column **Edition_read**), translated title (**Er_Title**), language (**Er_Language**), publishing house (**Er_Publishing_House**) and translator's surname (or curator's,**Translator**).

Once done, I exported the table as a .csv file. In this way, I had a small dataset ready to be uploaded on GitHub, in the main brench of this first repository.
